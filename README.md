# pharmacy-management

This project deals with pharmacy management where we use a desktop application to supervise the smooth functioning of a pharmaceutical organization. The Pharmacy Management System establishes a better management system for pharmaceutical establishments by computerizing the records and providing an efficient framework for a hassle-free business. It includes the management of inventory, billing, suppliers, regular customers, and e-mail alerts. This project aims to seamlessly integrate itself in the better management of a pharmacy, increasing its efficiency and profit, and to develop and build a solid customer base.
